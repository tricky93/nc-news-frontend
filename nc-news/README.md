## Getting Started

You can fork or clone this repo to access the code or you can visit [nc-news-pw](https://nc-news-pw.herokuapp.com/) to view the finished project.

### Prerequisites

```
    axios: ^0.18.0,
    bulma: ^0.7.1,

    react: ^16.4.1,
    react-dom: "^16.4.1,
    react-router-dom: ^4.3.1

### Installing

Axios calls the [api](https://nc-news-portfolio.herokuapp.com/) hosted on heroku. Detail on which can be found on my [github profile](https://github.com/tricky93/BE-FT-northcoders-news).

If you wish to change the api axios calls go into the src folder and find the file `api.js`. From here change the url variable at the top of the page to hit your desired end point
